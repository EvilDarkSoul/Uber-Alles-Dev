 THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_NAME:0 "The Storm has Passed"
 THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Following the long, brutal stalemate in the Urals, the Greater Germanic Reich celebrates its triumph over the Russian Bear. After their defeat, the Soviets enter a reclusive era, waiting for their grand return. After America proved its might against the Japanese, they set their focus on a bigger threat. America seeks to protect their interests in a hostile Europe. With the collapse of Italy, the divided peninsula becomes yet another front in the emerging Cold War."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The War’s end brings about a new era upon the British Isles. The rapid transition into demobilisation and rebuilding have begun. However, the Union Jack seeks to protect her empire in Africa, the Atlantic, and Pacific. However, rising calls for autonomy tear the empire apart from the inside as Westminster struggles to maintain its grip against the Swastika; something evident within the Nigeria situation. How the UK sails forwards during these times is anyone’s guess following demands to a return to true democracy."
 FRA_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "For the second time in 50 years, the German banner flies amongst the clouds over Paris. For over 6 years, Paris and the north were under direct garrison from the Wehrmacht. Surprising for many, France remained intact, with the borders pushed westward. Despite this, the entire French economy is reliant on Germania and severe military restrictions enforced by the Paris treaty limit the French army to mere militia units."
 GER_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "20 years since the Swastika was first raised over the Reichstag is celebrated across the streets of Germania. Now, in place of the Hammer and Sickle, the Swastika flies high over Eastern Europe. Although Lebensraum has been secured, it has become a chore rather than an opportunity; an impending economic collapse and a bloated, inefficient Wehrmacht grow ever more common following the Reich’s victory in Europe."
 ITA_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Following the devastating losses during the brutal Ural deadlock, many thought any remnants of the Great Rus’ would be lost to history. Despite major setbacks, an elderly Stalin leads the Union’s remnants during his last days. The Union is in an ever crumbling state, with the Reich of Evil almost seizing the A-A Line, and a revolting Turkic minority in the South. It is up to the next leader to pick up the Hammer and Sickle left behind by Stalin and guide the Union into a bold new era."
 USA_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "After the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, America fired up her industrial might, defeating the Imperialist Japanese. Still high on their victory, America sets her sights on the evil Fascists in Europe. She sees Italy's collapse as an opportunity, and seizes the South to gain a foothold on the continent and defend her might in the looming cold war. With the liberation of the Asian and Pacific nations, the United States must lead the free world to its rightful victory." 
 OTHER_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 #POL_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 #CAN_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 #SAF_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 #NZL_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 #RAJ_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 #SWI_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Switzerland is unique among the nations of Europe. It stands as a multicultural and decentralized nation founded on the principles of mutual respect and support.\n\nIts staunchly held neutrality survived the Great War, and after seeing its horrors from a distance, it's more convinced than ever of its need to defend itself. As the shadow of war looms closer, this peaceful nation must choose whether to remain neutral and deter any invaders through Armed Neutrality, to form a reluctant alliance with one of its neighbors, or to proactively defeat her enemies before they dare consider interloping."
 #CZE_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 #HUN_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 #ROM_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 #YUG_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:1 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."
#= CHI_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 #PRC_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 #MAN_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 #WARLORDS_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 #MEXICO_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Mexico faced two decades of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 #NETHERLANDS_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 #SPAIN_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "In the first five years of its existence, the fledgling Second Spanish Republic has already had to deal with strikes, a military coup attempt, and a major revolutionary uprising. Though it has survived these challenges, Spanish society continues to be marred by political polarization and violence between anarchists, communists, and falangists.\n\nBoth sides look towards the upcoming 1936 general election with hopeful eyes, but it is unlikely that the victory of either side will bring a return to stability. And as the violence continues, the military waits and plots..."
 #PORTUGAL_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Since Salazar's rise to power in 1932, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the First Republic. Fiscal Autonomy and Political Independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army. \n\nNow, Portugal must decide the way forward as political and social instability increases in neighboring Spain and international tensions are hopelessly worsening..."
 #LIT_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "With a Poland still thirsting to entrap Lithuania in a new Commonwealth, the Soviets failing to acknowledge Lithuania's right to self-determination, and a growing Nazi threat in the Memel region, a veteran from the independence war has risen to preserve the stability and independence of the Lithuanian nation. With the limited resources at his disposal, Antanas Smetona sits at the head of an unstable regime; with the fascist Iron Wolf paramilitary prowling the countryside, enraged by the imprisonment of their leader: Augustinas Voldemares. With war on the horizon, Lithuania must defend her people, no matter the cost."
 #LAT_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:1 "It has been two years since the May Coup and Latvia remains in an uncertain state. Kārlis Ulmanis who once served as Latvia’s Prime Minister now styles himself as dictator, with democratic supporters heavily opposing this attack on Latvian liberty. The fascist Perkonkrust organization has been agitated by the arrest of their leader; Gustavs Celmiņš, and if the dictatorship does not swiftly eradicate this threat, Latvia risks civil war.\n\nWith threats to the East and West, Latvia finds herself walking on a razor’s edge between victory and oblivion."
 #EST_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "With a communist threat in the East and a fascist one in the South, Konstantin Päts and the Isamaaliit have seized total control of the nation to secure Estonia’s future. A group of Estonian Independence War veterans have organized themselves into a movement known as the Vaps; right-wing populists who seek to wrestle control of the nation out of neutral hands.\n\nEstonia’s future remains uncertain. Will Päts keep the peace and bring about an Era of Silence, or will the Vaps take control and found a new Estonian state?"
 #BUL_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Since the Liberation War of 1878 and the rejection of the San Stefano Treaty by Western democracies, Bulgaria has lived through a long history of conflict and betrayal in the Balkans. As a defeated member of the Central Powers in the Great War, Bulgaria suffered heavy territorial losses and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine imposed harsh economic sanctions and severe military restrictions. \n\nBut with the major political and social changes taking place in Europe, it is time for Bulgaria to choose its own path and find its rightful place in the Balkans."
 #GRE_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Greece is a nation in crisis. Royalists and republicans have perpetuated a fervent struggle for the nation's soul which resulted in the abolition of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1935. The king, an autocratic foreigner, remains a highly divisive figure with an uncertain future. \n\nDistracted by petty domestic politics, a malignant and revanchist Bulgaria has been allowed to fester in the north, while Greece’s long-time nemesis and new-found ally Turkey undergoes a political metamorphosis to the east, and that is to say nothing of the stirring monster on the other side of the Adriatic..."
 #TUR_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "From the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey was born. Turkish independence was won with blood and bullets in the National Campaign of 1923, and while the struggle was righteous the cost continues to weigh heavily upon the Turkish people. \n\nReligious conservatives plague the hinterlands and resist nation-wide modernization efforts in the strongest terms, while Kurdish nationalists wreak havoc in the east of the country. Lionized president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk must unite the country or pass the torch to a leader who can, and they must do it soon as trouble stirs in Europe..."
 #ETH_THE_STORM_HAS_PASSED_DESC:0 "Ethiopia has a history stretching back centuries and an imperial dynasty to match. While Haile Selassie has made great strides to modernize the empire, the process has been interrupted as Ethiopia finds itself under attack from Italy for the second time in 40 years. The situation is bleak, but if the empire pulls together, it can halt the invaders once again. \n\nFor Ethiopia to remain free, the whole of East-Africa must be liberated from the yoke of European rule, once and for all."
